0.6.2 / 17.03.2018
==================

  * Added support for using `mini-css-extract-plugin` instead of `extract-text-webpack-plugin` for Webpack 4. If using `cssBundle: true` feature then also pass `useMiniCssExtractPlugin: true` option in case using `mini-css-extract-plugin` instead of `extract-text-webpack-plugin`.

0.6.1 / 27.02.2018
==================

  * Fixed Webpack 4 throwing "webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin has been removed, please use config.optimization.splitChunks instead" error.

0.6.0 / 05.01.2018
==================

  * Some code refactoring performed, some things could theoretically get broken, but it's unlikely.

  * (breaking change) `universal-webpack` command no longer receives the optional `--config` argument: instead it only uses an optional `--basePath` argument which can either be set to Webpack configuration `.context` or it can be omitted in which case it's gonna be the folder from which the `universal-webpack` command is being run. This base path is being used to resolve the `server` path inside `./universal-webpack-settings.js`.

  * Added support for [`oneOf` loaders](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#rule-oneof).

0.5.0 / 23.12.2017
==================

  * Added `loadExternalModuleFileExtensions` which now "excludes from externals" various webpack-loaded assets like CSS files.

0.4.0 / 04.09.2017
==================

  * Removed any mentions of `babel-register` from this library because the server-side bundle is already being compiled by `babel-loader`

0.3.9 / 09.04.2017
==================

  * `server()` now waits for `webpack-chunks.json` file to be generated by Webpack before starting

0.3.8 / 29.03.2017
==================

  * Added new exports: `universal-webpack/config` and `universal-webpack/server`. The old way of importing still works: these two are just the new approach discussed in a [relevant issue](https://github.com/catamphetamine/universal-webpack/issues/23).

0.3.7 / 10.03.2017
==================

  * Fixed `babel-register`'s `ignore` function on Windows (because Babel seems to be using `/` instead of `\` in the file paths)

0.3.6 / 06.03.2017
==================

  * Only checking `devServer` setting for `publicPath` in development mode

0.3.4 / 02.03.2017
==================

  * Fixed npm "private" packages (`@private/package`) not being marked as external dependencies

0.3.3 / 15.02.2017
==================

  * Renamed `extract-text-webpack-plugin` deprecated options: `fallbackLoader` -> `fallback`, `loader` -> `use`

0.3.2 / 14.02.2017
==================

  * Added `configuration` named parameter to the `server()` caller (along with the old `chunks()` named function parameter)

0.3.0 / 30.01.2017
==================

  * Instead of using `fake-style-loader` now using `css-loader/locals`
  * Not emitting `file-loader`'s files during the server side build now (make sure your favicon is included on the client side then)

0.2.6 / 28.01.2017
==================

  * Fixed the latest version of extract text plugin

0.2.5 / 24.01.2017
==================

  * Added `babel-register` options for server side startup speed up

0.2.0 / 05.01.2017
==================

  * Now only supports Webpack 2 (which is gonna be released soon; use `@2.2.0-rc.3` in the meanwhile). Use the old `0.1.x` version for Webpack 1.

0.1.44 / 19.12.2016
===================

  * A small fix for Webapack 2 `module.rules`

0.1.43 / 13.12.2016
===================

  * A small fix for `externals`

0.1.42 / 13.12.2016
===================

  * `context` is now `process.cwd()` by default (as per Webpack docs)

0.1.40 / 21.09.2016
===================

  * Fixed `__dirname` and `__filename` in server-side builds

0.1.39 / 01.09.2016
===================

  * Fixes server bundle not yet has been written to disk

0.1.37 / 19.08.2016
===================

  * Added `silent` option (won't output client side webpack build stats to console; e.g. when using `webpack-dashboard`)

0.1.33 / 21.07.2016
===================

  * `server` running function now returns a `Promise` with a result of whatever is returned from the user supplied `server(parameters)` function

0.1.31 / 20.07.2016
===================

  * `devtools` is now a function

0.1.28 / 20.07.2016
===================

  * `development: false` option now automatically extracts styles with `extract-text-webpack-plugin` (unless `css_bundle` is `false`) (the CSS bundle filename can be customized with `css_bundle: "filename.css"`)

0.1.26 / 19.07.2016
===================

  * Constrained "flash of unstyled content" fix to setting an additional flag: `css_bundle`. Because this feature can introduce a bug if used unproperly.

0.1.21 / 19.07.2016
===================

  * Added the third parameter to Webpack configuration creators. The parameter added is an object of options. It can have a property called `development` with `true/false` value. It is used in client-side configuration creation to solve the "flash of unstyled content" on page reload.

0.1.17 - 0.1.20 / 09.07.2016
===================

  * Plugin removal bug fix
  * Added `exclude_from_externals` module
  * Covered external modules resolution with tests

0.1.16 / 09.07.2016
===================

  * Removing `CommonsChunkPlugin` from server-side configuration

0.1.15 / 30.06.2016
==================

  * Removing `HotModuleReplacementPlugin` from server-side configuration

0.1.14 / 25.06.2016
==================

  * `@papigers` fixed server-side code error swallowing

0.1.13 / 13.06.2016
==================

  * Fixing `webpack-dev-server` overwriting `configuration.output.path`

0.1.12 / 31.05.2016
==================

  * Now replacing `style-loader` with `fake-style-loader` for server-side Webpack configuration

0.1.10 / 27.05.2016
==================

  * Fixed `ExtractTextPlugin`

0.1.8 / 26.05.2016
==================

  * Fixed `resolve.alias`
  * Fixed Babel export issues during server-side code importing

0.1.3 / 23.05.2016
==================

  * Fixed "Cannot find module 'colors/safe'"

0.1.2 / 21.05.2016
==================

  * Fixed hot reload on server-side (restarts Node.js (Nodemon) on code changes)

0.1.1 / 21.05.2016
==================

  * Removed the global `_server_` variable (too specific for the project, anyone can set it using Webpack's `DefinePlugin` inside `webpack.config.server.js`)

0.1.0 / 21.05.2016
==================

  * Initial release
